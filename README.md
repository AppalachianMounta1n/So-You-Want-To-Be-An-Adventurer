# So-You-Want-To-Be-An-Adventurer
In honor of my late friend CodeNamedAzreal, I'd like to use this repository to work on finishing what optimizations and bug fixes I can complete for his Minecraft 1.18.2 modpack, So You Want To Be An Adventurer, for an "In Memoriam" version of the modpack.

## Current Bugs
- Skill UI overlaps itself. Skill list could be better if moved to the bottom left instead of top left of the screen
- This issue is more with the mod that adds fantasy races, but the races could use more explanation as to difficulty and how they start

## Quest Formatting TODOs
